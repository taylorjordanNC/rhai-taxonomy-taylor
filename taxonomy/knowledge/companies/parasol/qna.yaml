      In the insurance industry, accurately predicting the likelihood of claims is essential for risk assessment and
      policy pricing. However, Parasol insurance claims datasets frequently suffer from class imbalance, where the
      number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual claims. This class imbalance poses challenges for
      predictive modeling, often leading to biased models favoring the majority class, resulting in subpar performance
      for the minority class, which is typically of greater interest.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is class imbalance in the context of Parasol insurance claims datasets?
        answer: |
          Class imbalance refers to the situation where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual
          claims, making predictive modeling difficult and potentially leading to biased models.
      - question: What types of information are included in the Policyholder Information feature?
        answer: |

      permit for at least six months and complete 40 hours of supervised driving (including 10 hours at night or in
      inclement weather) before they can apply for a license. Until a teen driver turns 18, he or she will get a
      provisional license, which prohibits the driver from riding with passengers under the age of 21 and from being on
      the road between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM. Teens may drive during those hours if a driver older than 21 is in the car
      with them. Restrictions are lifted at age 18. Teenage drivers in New Hampshire are allowed to practice driving
      beginning at age 15 ½ while accompanied by a licensed adult at least 25 years of age in the front passenger seat.
